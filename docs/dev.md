## Current Application State and Architecture Overview

Flow is currently a functional VS Code custom editor extension with a webview-based notebook UI. It supports block-based command execution with real-time streaming, stdin handling, process control (kill), and context tracking (cwd and git branch).

The architecture is split between three main components:

- **Webview (React UI)**: Handles the presentation and user interaction within the notebook interface.
- **Extension (Message orchestration and state management)**: Acts as the central authority, managing the flow of data and coordinating between the UI and the execution layer.
- **ExecutionEngine (Process execution layer)**: Responsible for spawning shells, managing processes, capturing output streams, and handling graceful process termination.

**Current Stage of Development**:

- **Shell Resolution**: Implemented but actively being refined toward a single source of truth using the `ResolvedShell` object to eliminate duplicated data.
- **Testing**: Partially set up. We use Vitest for testing the engine and webview components, and Mocha for the core extension tests.
- **Platform Specifics**: Improvements are in progress, such as utilizing interactive shells for `bash`/`zsh` to preserve user environments (like aliases) while handling TTY limitations gracefully.

### Recent Fixes & Updates

- **Branch Rendering in Webview (InputSection.tsx)**: Fixed a local bug in where the branch indicator was not correctly rendered. The previous implementation incorrectly used the nullish coalescing operator `??`, causing a truthy branch name like `"main"` to render as raw unstyled inline text without the wrapper or icons. Attempting to restrict the type inside the default `div` failed because `false ?? context.branch` evaluates to `false`. The fix now explicitly checks `typeof context.branch === "string" && (...)` ensuring that branch names consistently and safely render the proper icon and flex layouts, ignoring empty state edge-cases.
- **Shell Interactive Mode Fix**: Shell profiles for `bash` and `zsh` were updated to use `-l` (login) instead of `-i` (interactive) due to unpredictable behavior and `zle` errors when run without a real PTY. However, login shells do not always load user-specific setups like aliases or toolchains (`nvm`, `pyenv`) defined in `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`. To guarantee a consistent and rich user environment across blocks, `PosixAdapter` natively prepends conditional `source ~/.bashrc` and `source ~/.zshrc` (silenced via `2>/dev/null`) directly to the base execution string prior to running the user command. Additionally, the wrapper string uses `.join("\n")` rather than semicolons to execute a robust heredoc `eval`, effectively ensuring `export_aliases`/`aliases` behavior is turned on *before* the user command is locally parsed by the terminal.
- **Collision-Safe ID Generation**: Updated the `generateId` utility to use the native Web Crypto API (`crypto.randomUUID()`) natively available in modern Node and browser environments. This replaces the old `Math.random()` approach which was unsafe during high-concurrency execution and posed a latent risk for block ID collisions in the execution registry.

This summary provides a clear understanding of what is already stable, what is evolving, and where to contribute next.
