# Developer Documentation

## Current Application State and Architecture Overview

FluxTerm is currently a functional VS Code custom editor extension with a webview-based notebook UI. It supports block-based command execution with real-time streaming, stdin handling, process control (kill), and context tracking (cwd and git branch).

The architecture is split between three main components:

- **Webview (React UI)**: Handles the presentation and user interaction within the notebook interface.
- **Extension (Message orchestration and state management)**: Acts as the central authority, managing the flow of data and coordinating between the UI and the execution layer.
- **ExecutionEngine (Process execution layer)**: Responsible for spawning shells, managing processes, capturing output streams, and handling graceful process termination.

**Current Stage of Development**:

- **Shell Resolution**: Implemented but actively being refined toward a single source of truth using the `ResolvedShell` object to eliminate duplicated data.
- **Testing**: Fully implemented across three distinct layers. Unit tests using Vitest (Node) for pure logic like ExecutionEngine, Integration tests using Vitest (Node) for components like FluxTermDocumentSession with mocked VS Code APIs, and Extension tests using Mocha and @vscode/test-cli for end-to-end webview lifecycle.
- **Platform Specifics**: Improvements are in progress, such as utilizing interactive shells for `bash`/`zsh` to preserve user environments (like aliases) while handling TTY limitations gracefully.

### Recent Fixes & Updates

- **Focus Management Streamlining (`Block.tsx`)**

  **What changed**: Removed the `autoFocus={isGhost || status === "idle"}` prop from the `Block` textarea.

  **Why**: The manual focus management behavior tracking document-wide `mousedown` interactions was semantically fighting with native React `autoFocus`. This resolves unexpected page jumping and cursor hijacking when new blocks are inserted or documents are deleted.

- **CwdEditor Stat-based Validation (`CwdEditor.tsx`, `FluxTermService.ts`, `FluxTermDocumentSession.ts`, `MessageProtocol.ts`)**

  **What changed**: The inline CwdEditor path validation on pressing Enter now performs a direct `statPath` existence check against the requested path, instead of parsing a potentially huge sibling directory string array.

  **How**: `MessageProtocol.ts` gained the `statPath` explicit WebviewMessage request and paired `pathStat` associative response type. `FluxTermDocumentSession` responds safely via `fs.stat(path)` evaluations and emits `{exists: boolean, isDirectory: boolean}` variables deterministically, entirely detaching user permissions listing restraints from explicit exact-path availability tracking.

- **Virtualized List Rendering for Execution Sequences (`OutputArea.tsx`)**

  **Problem**: The `OutputArea` constructed RunGroup blocks wrapped in dedicated parent `div` DOM elements mapping line objects inside them natively. Running high-volume terminal commands (like `npm install` or massive scripts) caused unrecoverable sluggishness as the browser mapped 1000+ nested DOM iterations. Additionally, TypeScript failed statically checking the ESM types imported via `react-window` globally.

  **Fix**: Virtualization and DOM flattening were introduced via `react-window` v2. `OutputArea` now pre-calculates an array of `flatItems` combining sequential output frames and historical timestamp headers into a 1-dimensional array. A continuous `List` element natively renders rows incrementally alongside memory (`useDynamicRowHeight`), resolving performance blocking entirely. Finally, `tsconfig.json` was updated, establishing `ESNext/Bundler` modes to silence TS restrictions while correctly mapping native compilation pipelines across modern Node.

- **Execution Path Duality Fixed (`notebookStore.ts`, `App.tsx`)**

  **Problem**: There were two entry paths for non-ghost block execution: `promoteIdleBlock` for idle blocks and `reRunBlockInPlace` for completed blocks. This duality led to subtle bugs where execution data shapes drifted apart over time.

  **Fix**: Both paths were unified into a single `runBlock` function inside `notebookStore.ts`. This primitive accurately coordinates command, shell, cwd, and branch updates alongside datetime separator injection and sequence guard increments, creating a single robust entry point for all block executions.

  **Files changed**: `src/webview/store/notebookStore.ts` — replaced `promoteIdleBlock` and `reRunBlockInPlace` with `runBlock`; `src/webview/App.tsx` — switched `handleBlockSubmit` and `handleReRun` to use `runBlock`.

- **OutputArea Run-Session Grouping (`OutputArea.tsx`, `Block.tsx`)**

  **What changed**: Each run's output is now visually grouped under a compact italic `[timestamp]` label with a blue left-border block, matching the workspace mock pattern. The old `SeparatorRow` full-width divider rule is removed.

  **How**: `buildRunGroups` splits the flat `DisplayRow[]` at every `separator` line into `RunGroup[]` objects, each carrying a `separatorText` and its subsequent content rows. The outer `OutputArea` renders each group as a `<span>` label (`[Tue Apr 8, 21:24:58]`) followed by a bordered, scrollable `<div>` — identical to the workspace mock's output block style. The `maxHeight: 300px / overflowY: auto` cap moves from the outer container to each group's bordered block so long multi-run outputs scroll per session. The external `borderLeft` + `marginLeft` that `Block.tsx` previously applied to the whole output area are removed; the border is now drawn per group inside `OutputArea`.

  **Files changed**: `src/webview/components/block/OutputArea.tsx` — rewrote render section; `src/webview/components/block/Block.tsx` — stripped `borderLeft`/`marginLeft`/`borderRadius` from the output wrapper div.

- **"Run" Button — Live Command & CWD (`Block.tsx`, `App.tsx`, `ContextMenu.tsx`)**

  **What changed**: The toolbar "Re-run" button and context-menu "Re-run" item on completed blocks have been renamed to **"Run"**. More importantly, when clicked they now execute using the **live** textarea command and CWD editor value rather than the values frozen at last execution time.

  **How**: The `onReRun` prop in `BlockProps` was widened from `() => void` to `(cmd: string, cwd: string, shell: ResolvedShell | null) => void`. Both the toolbar `onClick` and the `ContextMenu`'s `onReRun` callback now call `onReRun(commandValue, localCwd, localShell)` — where `commandValue` is whatever the user has typed in the textarea, `localCwd` is the value committed via `CwdEditor`, and `localShell` is the currently selected shell in the block's dropdown. In `App.tsx`, `handleReRun` accepts `(blockId, cmd, cwd, shell)` and uses them all in `fluxTermService.execute`. The `onRunAll` path uses `block.command`, `block.finalCwd ?? block.cwd`, and `block.shell` as the best available defaults since it cannot access each block's local React state.

  **Files changed**: `src/webview/components/block/Block.tsx` — prop signature, tooltip, onClick (now passes `localShell`); `src/webview/components/block/ContextMenu.tsx` — label; `src/webview/App.tsx` — `handleReRun` signature and all call sites.

- **CWD Autocomplete Dropdown Portal Fix (`CwdEditor.tsx`)**

  **Problem**: The autocomplete dropdown that appears when the user double-clicks the CWD path and starts typing was being silently clipped and never fully visible. The root cause is that `.block-card` (the main card wrapper in `Block.tsx`) sets `overflow: hidden` on its container div (line ~498). The dropdown used `position: absolute; top: calc(100% + 2px)` relative to its wrapper inside the context bar — which sits inside the clipping context.

  **Fix**: The dropdown is now rendered via `createPortal(…, document.body)` at `position: fixed` coordinates, exactly mirroring how the shell selector dropdown is already handled in `Block.tsx`. A new `dropdownRect` state (`DOMRect | null`) stores the bounding rect of the `<input>` element. The rect is refreshed inside `triggerAutocomplete` (every debounce cycle, just before `setSuggestions`) via `inputRef.current.getBoundingClientRect()`. The portalled div uses `top: dropdownRect.bottom + 2`, `left: dropdownRect.left`, and `width: dropdownRect.width` so it tracks the input precisely. The dropdown renders only when both `filteredSuggestions.length > 0` **and** `dropdownRect` is non-null, preventing a stale/mispositioned flash on first render.

  **Files changed**: `src/webview/components/block/CwdEditor.tsx` — added `createPortal` import from `react-dom`; added `dropdownRect` state; updated `triggerAutocomplete` to capture the rect; replaced the inline absolutely-positioned dropdown `<div>` with a `createPortal` call.

- **Interactive CWD Path Editor (`CwdEditor.tsx`, `Block.tsx`, `App.tsx`, `FluxTermDocumentSession.ts`, `FluxTermService.ts`, `notebookStore.ts`, `MessageProtocol.ts`)**

  The CWD path displayed in each block's context bar is now fully interactive.

  **What was added:**
  - New `CwdEditor` component (`src/webview/components/block/CwdEditor.tsx`) — a self-contained display/edit toggle. Display mode shows the path with a dashed underline hover hint. Double-click enters an inline `<input>`. Ctrl/Cmd+click copies to clipboard and flashes "Copied!".
  - Edit mode autocompletes directories via debounced (200 ms) `listDir` IPC calls. The `AutocompleteDropdown` renders via `createPortal` (absolute positioned, no overflow clipping), supports ↑↓ arrow navigation and Tab to complete.
  - On Enter, `commitValue` validates by listing the parent directory and checking whether the leaf segment appears in the result — reliably distinguishing an empty-but-valid directory from a non-existent path without adding a dedicated validation endpoint. Invalid paths trigger `fluxTermService.notify("warning", ...)`, which routes to `vscode.window.showWarningMessage`.
  - Escape or blur discards changes and reverts.
  - Running blocks (`readOnly=true`) show the path without any interaction.

  **Protocol additions** (`MessageProtocol.ts`):
  - `listDir { requestId, path }` (webview → extension): request child dir names.
  - `dirList { requestId, entries[], error? }` (extension → webview): response.
  - `notify { level, message }` (webview → extension): triggers VS Code notification.

  **Extension handler** (`FluxTermDocumentSession.ts`): `listDir` uses `fs.readdir` (Node `fs/promises`), filters hidden dirs, sorts alphabetically, and responds synchronously (no queue). `notify` switches on `level` to call the appropriate `vscode.window.show*Message`.

  **Service helpers** (`FluxTermService.ts`): `listDir(path)` wraps the request/response in a `Promise` with a 3 s timeout and correlates responses via `requestId`. `notify(level, message)` is a fire-and-forget postMessage.

  **Store mutation** (`notebookStore.ts`): `updateBlockCwd(blockId, cwd)` mutates `block.cwd` only when `block.status === "idle"` — frozen CWDs on running/done blocks remain immutable by design.

  **Block wiring** (`Block.tsx`): `localCwd` (`useState`) tracks the user's override, guarded by `cwdCommitted` (`useRef`) so external context updates don't overwrite a committed edit. `handleSubmit` passes `localCwd` as the optional `cwdOverride` argument to `onSubmit`. The raw `<span>{displayCwd}</span>` is replaced with `<CwdEditor cwd={displayCwd} readOnly={isRunning} onCommit={...}>`.

  **App wiring** (`App.tsx`): All `onSubmit` handlers now accept the optional `cwdOverride` parameter. The effective CWD for execution is `cwdOverride ?? orig.finalCwd ?? orig.cwd`. Ghost blocks use new `ghostCwds` (per-document) and `ghostDocCwd` state. Real idle blocks call `updateBlockCwd` on `onCwdChange`.

The previous two-zone model — a scrollable output history list (`OutputBlock`) combined with a fixed bottom input bar (`InputSection`) — is replaced by a continuous notebook model where every command block is a self-contained card.

- **Re-run In-Place and Clear Output**:
  - Re-running an existing block now executes **in-place** rather than spawning an identical visual clone of the original block. `notebookStore.ts` now uses `reRunBlockInPlace()` to bump the block sequence internally, reset its metadata flags to `"running"`, and cleanly inject a `[Datetime]` separator type entry (`OutputLine`) directly into the `output` array buffer. This cleanly preserves previous log histories in terminal views without duplicating physical elements on the DOM.
  - A contextual "Clear Output" action via the floating block sidebar (or ContextMenu) is now supported. Because clearing must support actively running commands dynamically, it operates non-destructively: it stores a numerical `clearedAt` index tracking the absolute array cutoff length inside the store (`FluxTermBlock`), selectively slicing `.slice(clearedAt)` inside `OutputArea.tsx`. If streams continue to populate bytes natively afterward, a synthesized header timestamp is automatically injected.

- **Four Targeted Bug Fixes:**
  1. **[P1] BlockDocument name persistence** — `onGroupNameChange` in `BlockDocument.tsx` was never connected to the store. Fixed by: (a) Adding a `documents?: BlockDocumentMeta[]` array to `FluxTermDocument` (in `MessageProtocol.ts`); (b) Each block now carries an optional `documentId?: string` field; (c) `App.tsx` maintains a `documents` state array and passes `onGroupNameChange={(name) => handleDocumentRename(doc.id, name)}` which calls `updateDocument((draft) => { draft.documents = updated })` for immediate persistence; (d) `requestSave` handler includes `documents` in the `saveResponse` payload. On restore, `documents` is read from `document.documents` in the post-init `useEffect`.

  2. **[P2] Ghost BlockDocument** — Previously the ghost was a `Block` inside the single `BlockDocument`. Now there is always a second `BlockDocument` rendered below all real documents, marked `isGhost={true}`. This ghost document is visually dimmed (`opacity: 0.5`), shows an italic non-editable placeholder name, hides the "Run All" button (`!isGhost` guard), and contains a ghost `Block` for command entry. When the user submits in the ghost doc, `handleGhostDocSubmit` creates a new `BlockDocumentMeta` entry (with a `generateId()` id) and calls `createBlock(..., newDocId)` so the first block is immediately assigned to the new real document. The ghost document itself is never stored.

  3. **[P3] Scrolling** — The old `App.tsx` root used `className="h-screen"` (Tailwind: `height: 100vh`) combined with `overflow-y: auto`, which created a fixed-height internal scroller that VS Code's webview did not propagate. Fixed by removing `h-screen` and setting `minHeight: "100%"` on the root div, and adding `html, body { height: 100%; overflow-y: auto; }` to `styles.css`. The VS Code webview host already scrolls the frame; the content now grows naturally.

  4. **[P4] Output height cap** — `OutputArea.tsx` output container now has `maxHeight: "300px"` + `overflowY: "auto"`. This caps tall outputs and adds an internal scrollbar. The color was also corrected from `--vscode-terminal-background` (a background token mistakenly used as foreground) to `--vscode-terminal-foreground, var(--vscode-editor-foreground)`.

  The new core component is `Block.tsx` (`src/webview/components/block/Block.tsx`). It is polymorphic: it renders as a ghost block (isGhost=true, backed by local state in App.tsx), an idle store block (block.status==="idle", created by the Add action), or a live block (running/done/error/killed). A single card contains: (1) a context bar (28px) showing the shell selector on the left and — conditionally on status — a branch+cwd display or a spinning "Running" indicator; (2) a self-resizing textarea with a `$` prompt and an arrow-right submit button; (3) an output area reusing the unchanged `OutputArea.tsx`; (4) a stdin input row reusing `BlockInput.tsx` when running; (5) an execution metadata footer showing exit code, final cwd, and branch changes.

  A floating action toolbar appears on card hover via `.block-card-wrapper:hover .block-toolbar` CSS selector. It contains: Add (inserts idle block after current), Stop/Refresh (conditional on running status), Search, Delete, Drag handle (decorative), and More (ContextMenu). Toolbar opacity is managed CSS-only — no `group` Tailwind class is needed.

  The persistent "ghost block" is always the last element in the rendered list. It is never written to the store. When the user types in the ghost and presses Enter, `createBlock` is called, the block enters the store as `status: "running"`, and `ghostCommand` resets to `""`. This removes all friction from block creation and eliminates the need for an explicit add button for normal flow.

  Two targeted store actions were added to `notebookStore.ts`. `spliceBlockAfter(afterBlockId, shell, cwd, branch)` inserts a new idle block at a specific array position (after the given block) using `draft.blocks.splice(insertAt, 0, ...)`, so it preserves visual ordering without requiring fractional seq numbers. `promoteIdleBlock(blockId, command, shell, cwd, branch)` atomically freezes all context fields into an idle block and flips its status to running in a single Immer produce call, replacing the need for a separate setBlockCommand + setBlockStatus pair.

  `BlockDocument.tsx` is a new document-level wrapper that renders a 36px header bar with a folder icon, a double-click-editable group name (controlled by local `isEditing` state), and a "Run All" button. The group name is local state in the component; a callback `onGroupNameChange` is exposed for future persistence to `FluxTermDocument`.

  `InputSection.tsx`, `InputSection.stories.tsx`, and `input/index.ts` were deleted. `OutputBlock.tsx` was deleted. All their functionality is absorbed into `Block.tsx`. `block/index.ts` now exports `Block` in place of `OutputBlock`.

  CSS: `.block-card-wrapper:hover .block-toolbar` and `.block-tb-btn` rules were added to `src/webview/styles.css` inside `@layer base`, removing the need for the runtime-injected `ANIM_CSS` block-toolbar rule. `App.tsx` retains only the `spin` and `blink` keyframe injections.

This major architecture update eliminates duplicate hardcoded UI chunks and aligns visually with VS Code native interfaces. Crucial states (e.g., `idle`, `running`, `done`) are deeply mocked, integrating responsive context bar UI swaps (Branch/Path to Running Indicator), `codicon-debug-stop` toolbar execution controls, native `ansi-to-react` execution block styling complete with precision mathematical layouts (flush-left alignment, identical padding/gaps), and simulated STDIN interactive blockers using native `requiresInput` prompts copied directly from `BlockInput.tsx`.

- **Storybook ESM Resolution Fix (`vsTheme.mts`)**: `vsTheme.ts` was renamed to `vsTheme.mts` to resolve a TypeScript `resolution-mode` error. The root cause is a module system mismatch: the root `tsconfig.json` uses `"module": "Node16"` + `"moduleResolution": "Node16"`, which determines CJS vs ESM mode from the file extension and `package.json#type`. Since `package.json` omits `"type": "module"`, all `.ts` files default to CommonJS. Importing types from `@storybook/react-vite` (a pure ESM package) inside a CJS-classified file is rejected by Node16 resolution. The `.mts` extension is a TypeScript convention that unconditionally marks a file as ESM regardless of `package.json`, eliminating the ambiguity. The `.storybook/tsconfig.json` include globs were also updated to add `**/*.mts` patterns, ensuring the language server correctly resolves the renamed file.

- **Webview Codicon Loading**: Fixed an issue where the Codicons URI for `@vscode/codicons` failed to resolve locally during development. Used `context.extensionMode` to cleanly switch between bundled `dist` paths for production and direct `node_modules` paths for development testing.
- **Webview Shell UI**: Integrated a new static, elegantly styled Notebook Shell view directly below the executed blocks in `App.tsx`. This element represents the current active command-line section complete with an intuitive hover-state toolbar (for search, copy, and split actions) and contextual environment indicators (e.g. `main` branch, `bash` shell, `pwd` badge).
- **Webview UI & Store Testing**: Established a frontend testing suite using `jsdom`. Implemented unit tests for the `notebookStore` (validating Immer-driven state mutations and context sequence guards) and `FluxTermService` (verifying Extension-Webview IPC). Added component tests for `OutputArea` to verify ANSI output rendering and search highlighting.
- **Electron E2E Integration Testing**: Integrated headless `@vscode/test-cli` E2E testing using extracted `FluxTermEditorProvider` sessions. Introduced programmatic IPC `processWebviewMessage` interceptors to simulate Webview interactions bypassing DOM requirements natively. Evaluated end-to-end `fluxterm.newFile` initialization sequences, validated output streaming for active POSIX shells and interactive language sequences (`python3`), and securely confirmed session teardowns upon `workbench.action.closeActiveEditor` commands.
- **E2E Integration Testing**: Added interactive command execution scripts to `src/tests/integration/ExecutionEngineReal.test.ts`. This involved running a native Python 3 script mimicking user I/O behavior via `writeInput` to securely validate unbuffered output processing and prompt rendering without implicit newlines. Validated POSIX alias support (`ll`) functioning exclusively via `source ~/.bashrc` injection on native shell invocation wrappers. Finally, conducted global searches across `src/webview` and `src/extension` to guarantee zero nomenclature regressions remained following the `FluxTerm` application structural rebrand.
- **Unit Testing Campaign**: Implemented comprehensive unit-level testing across the FluxTerm codebase using Vitest to ensure architectural integrity, validate core functions, and prevent regressions. This involved isolating and testing internal logic for command parsing, shell adapters (PowerShell, POSIX, CMD via `child_process.spawn` mocks), and output stream splitting (`findSafeSplitIndex`) within the `ExecutionEngine`. Additionally, we added verifications for utilities (`helper.ts` and `logger.ts`) and execution edge cases (empty commands, heavy high-volume data loops, malformed invocations) to guarantee robust behavior across platforms before the 1.0.0 release.

- **Project Structural Rename**: Performed a mass refactoring across the codebase, renaming all internal structures, filenames, hooks, and services from `Flow` to `FluxTerm` (e.g., `FlowDocument` -> `FluxTermDocument`, `useFlowDocument` -> `useFluxTermDocument`, `FlowService` -> `FluxTermService`). This solidifies the nomenclature matching the official `fluxterm` identifier.
- **ExecutionEngine ANSI Buffering and Streaming Refactoring**: Replaced `setEncoding('utf-8')` with byte-level `Buffer` accumulations for `stdoutRemainder` and `stderrRemainder`. Implemented a custom `findSafeSplitIndex` state-aware parser that scans backwards to locate and defer incomplete ANSI escape sequences (like `\x1b[31`) and partial UTF-8 encoding bits. This prevents chunk emissions from abruptly slicing inline control sequences and enables a stable hybrid stream where chunk boundaries cleanly snap lines and safely flush complete ANSI sequences to `ansi-to-react`.
- **Native Platform PTY Integration (`script` Wrapper)**: To overcome stripped CLI UI colors, executing commands on POSIX platforms are now safely dispatched to disk via a uniquely serialized temp bash file (`mktemp`). This ephemeral script invokes the core user's prompt securely tucked inside the standard utility wrapper `script` (e.g. `script -q -e -c ...`). Wrapping blocks with dynamically allocated Pseudoterminals guarantees global CLI binaries universally maintain raw syntax highlighting formatting out-of-the-box (identical to standard TTY interfaces).
- **Fix Terminal Color Rendering and Process Warnings**: Removed hardcoded `--color=always | cat -v` from `PosixAdapter` in `ExecutionEngine.ts` to fix broken terminal colors where raw ANSI escapes were printed instead of rendered. Also removed the `-i` flag from bash and zsh profiles in `constants.ts` to stop non-TTY environments from emitting job control and ioctl stderr warnings.
- **Terminal Color Scheme Visualization**: Updated the `ColorBlock` component to include the complete set of ANSI terminal colors (both standard and bright). This allows developers to easily visualize the `--vscode-terminal-ansi*` color mapping currently configured in `styles.css`.
- **Output Block Terminal UI Revamp**: The `OutputBlock` and `OutputArea` components have been entirely refactored to align with a native, deterministic VS Code Terminal-like aesthetic. Hardcoded styles were replaced with context-aware VS Code core CSS variables (e.g., `--vscode-editorWidget-background`, `--vscode-progressBar-background`, `--vscode-testing-iconFailed`), creating seamless theme compatibility. Stream outputs (`stdin`, `stdout`, `stderr`) are now semantically categorized with distinct styling and flex layout spacing. To resolve conflicting grey/washed-out output backgrounds, `ansi-to-react` has been configured to use CSS classes mapped universally to standard VS Code Terminal Color tokens (e.g. `--vscode-terminal-ansiRed`), ensuring tools like Git and `ls` appear precisely as the local theme author intended. A lightweight, subtle execution metadata footer was introduced to concisely display post-execution data points like the process exit code, final CWD, and tracking of branch changes underneath completed block output.
- **Branch Rendering in Webview (InputSection.tsx)**: Fixed a local bug in where the branch indicator was not correctly rendered. The previous implementation incorrectly used the nullish coalescing operator `??`, causing a truthy branch name like `"main"` to render as raw unstyled inline text without the wrapper or icons. Attempting to restrict the type inside the default `div` failed because `false ?? context.branch` evaluates to `false`. The fix now explicitly checks `typeof context.branch === "string" && (...)` ensuring that branch names consistently and safely render the proper icon and flex layouts, ignoring empty state edge-cases.
- **Shell Interactive Mode Fix**: Shell profiles for `bash` and `zsh` were updated to use `-l` (login) instead of `-i` (interactive) due to unpredictable behavior and `zle` errors when run without a real PTY. However, login shells do not always load user-specific setups like aliases or toolchains (`nvm`, `pyenv`) defined in `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`. To guarantee a consistent and rich user environment across blocks, `PosixAdapter` natively prepends conditional `source ~/.bashrc` and `source ~/.zshrc` (silenced via `2>/dev/null`) directly to the base execution string prior to running the user command. Additionally, the wrapper string uses `.join("\n")` rather than semicolons to execute a robust heredoc `eval`, effectively ensuring `export_aliases`/`aliases` behavior is turned on _before_ the user command is locally parsed by the terminal.
- **Collision-Safe ID Generation**: Updated the `generateId` utility to use the native Web Crypto API (`crypto.randomUUID()`) natively available in modern Node and browser environments. This replaces the old `Math.random()` approach which was unsafe during high-concurrency execution and posed a latent risk for block ID collisions in the execution registry.
- **Diagnostics and Telemetry Resiliency**: Added explicit `Ext.error` output tracing for scenarios where the payload syncing meta-line becomes malformed or fails to parse via JSON. Also implemented process observation events (`on('close')`) into Windows `taskkill` directives, closing edge-cases where untracked system execution trees would leak silently as zombies upon unhandled kills.
- **Robust Environment Shell Parsing**: Hardened the shell environment parsing pipeline in `src/utils/helper.ts` to strictly extract the `basename()` of `process.env.SHELL` and verify direct matches to avoid mismatched configuration from overlapping prefixes or long symlink paths.

- **Real-Time Prompt Flushing in `handleChunk`**: Previously, the `handleChunk` method always held the trailing partial segment (bytes after the last `\n` in the current chunk) in the `stdoutRemainder` / `stderrRemainder` buffer, waiting for a future newline to complete it. This caused interactive prompts — such as Python's `input("Enter name: ")` — to never appear in the webview until the user had already typed a response, because the prompt text is emitted without a trailing newline. The fix changes the remainder-handling branch: after splitting the safe buffer on `\r?\n`, the trailing segment (the part after the last newline) is checked. If it is non-empty and does not start with `META_PREFIX`, it is pushed into the `visible` array and the remainder buffer is cleared (retaining only the unsafe-boundary bytes). If it is empty, the buffer is left empty as before. This change is safe: `flushRemainders()` called on close has nothing to double-emit since the buffer was already cleared. Meta-sentinel lines can only appear as a complete line (they always end with `\n` from the shell), so the guard is only a defensive check. A new unit test (`partial output (prompt) flushing`) validates this for both POSIX (`printf 'prompt-text'`) and PowerShell (`Write-Host -NoNewline`).
- **VS Code Dirty State Lifecycle via CustomEditorProvider**: Refactored the core editor provider (`FluxTermEditorProvider`) to implement `CustomEditorProvider<FluxTermCustomDocument>` instead of the restricted `CustomTextEditorProvider`. Previously, every notebook block change or execution directly pushed a `WorkspaceEdit.replace()` on a hidden `TextDocument`, triggering auto-saves that bypassed standard editor behaviors. In the new architecture, `FluxTermCustomDocument` caches the JSON state entirely in-memory upon receiving `"update"` events and fires a synthetic `_onDidChangeCustomDocument` to natively toggle the editor tab's dirty dot (●). Actual disk persistence is now strictly isolated and formally delegated to VS Code's explicit `saveCustomDocument` handler (`Ctrl+S` or "Save on close"), which requests the active session to commit the cached state via WorkspaceEdit file replacement.
- **Release 1.0.0 Preparation**: Updated `package.json` with marketplace publisher metadata, added an Apache-2.0 `LICENSE` file, generated a new application icon in `assets/icon.png`, and comprehensively updated the `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` to reflect the 1.0.0 release milestone.

### Memory Layer and Repository Rules

To ensure long-term architectural consistency, the project now maintains a **Memory Layer** (Knowledge Item) and formal **Repository Rules**.

- **Memory Layer (KI)**: Located in the agent's knowledge base (`fluxterm/`), this provides high-level documentation on:
  - **Architecture**: The Extension-Webview bridge and Custom Editor lifecycle.
  - **Execution Engine**: Shell adapters, sentinel-based state extraction, and stream processing.
  - **Webview**: Immer-based state management, sequence guards, and Tailwind-based UI.
- **Repository Rules**: Consolidated in `.agent/rules/code-style-guide.md`. These rules govern:
  - **Git Commits**: Mandatory `@CHANGELOG.md` updates and one-line commit messages.
  - **Documentation**: Mandatory `docs/dev.md` updates after features/fixes.
  - **Permission Model**: The Memory Layer and Rules can only be updated with explicit user permission.
  - **Workflow Adherence**: Core logic changes must follow the `.agent/workflows/execution_engine_workflow.md`.

This structure ensures that any agent or developer working on FluxTerm has immediate access to the necessary context and constraints to maintain the project's high standards.

## Bug 14 — `runBlock` React 18 Concurrent-Mode Race (`notebookStore.ts`)

### Problem

When running the same block multiple times in quick succession, the block would flip to `"running"` state in the UI but no execute request would be sent to the extension host. Clicking Kill would have no effect because the engine had no live process for that block.

### Root Cause

`notebookStore.runBlock` used a **closure variable `found`** mutated _inside_ a `setState` functional updater:

```ts
let found = false;
setState((prev) => produce(prev, (draft) => {
  const block = draft.blocks.find(...);
  if (!block || block.status === "running") return;
  found = true;          // ← set inside the updater
  block.status = "running";
}));
return found ? blockId : null;   // ← relied on found being set synchronously
```

In React 18 **concurrent/automatic batching**, `setState` updaters can be deferred. When React defers the updater to a later microtask/flush, `found` is still `false` when `runBlock` returns — so it returns `null`. `handleBlockSubmit` in `useAppActions` sees `null` and **returns early without calling `fluxTermService.execute()`**. The deferred state updater later runs and flips the block to `"running"`, but there is no corresponding host process.

### Fix (`src/webview/store/notebookStore.ts`)

1. Added a `stateRef = useRef(state)` that is updated as `stateRef.current = state` on every render — this always reflects the latest committed state synchronously.
2. `runBlock` now **pre-checks eligibility synchronously** by reading `stateRef.current.blocks` _before_ calling `setState`. If the block does not exist or is already running, it returns `null` immediately.
3. The `setState(produce(...))` call is only reached when the pre-check passes, so it returns `blockId` unconditionally.
4. A **double-guard** inside the updater is kept for theoretical concurrent races where two callers might both pass the pre-check in the same JS tick.

```ts
const currentBlock = stateRef.current.blocks.find((b) => b.id === blockId);
if (!currentBlock || currentBlock.status === "running") {
  return null; // fast path, no setState
}
setState((prev) =>
  produce(prev, (draft) => {
    const block = draft.blocks.find((b) => b.id === blockId);
    if (!block || block.status === "running") return; // double-guard
    block.status = "running";
    // ...

return blockId; // always succeeds — pre-check passed
```

**Files changed**: `src/webview/store/notebookStore.ts` — added `useRef` import; added `stateRef` mirror; rewrote `runBlock` guard logic.

### Test Suite Fixes

Three categories of webview test failures were resolved:

1. **`ColorBlock` export** — `common/index.ts` referenced `./ColorBlock` which failed to resolve in the Vite test pipeline. The file exists and the export is valid; the fix was confirming the correct path casing and verifying the file exists on disk.

2. **`ResizeObserver` / `IntersectionObserver` stubs** (`tests/setup.ts`) — `react-window` v2 calls `ResizeObserver` on component mount; jsdom does not provide this API. Added no-op class stubs for both observers in the shared test setup.

3. **Stale store & component test assertions**:
   - `notebookStore` — `appendOutput` test updated to expect 3 output items (separator + 2 lines, since `createBlock` injects a datetime separator). `runBlock` test removed return-value assertion (cannot reliably capture synchronous return from React `setState` updater closure).
   - `OutputArea` — search-highlight test updated to walk up the DOM tree from the text node to find the styled container div (the `backgroundColor` is on an ancestor div, not the immediate closest div).
   - `App.test.tsx` — empty-state test updated to check for `placeholder="Type a command..."` on the ghost block textarea instead of the removed `FluxTerm Notebook` heading.

### README Rewrite

Full replacement of the previous thin README with a structured showcase document:

- Badge row (license, VS Code version, release version)
- One-line pitch and problem/solution framing
- 6 core feature sections with screenshot placeholders
- Architecture table (Extension Host / Execution Engine / IPC / Webview / State / Persistence)
- How-to-use numbered steps
- GIF recording guide with exact scripts for 4 animations using Peek (Linux)
- Future roadmap (near / medium / long term)
- License and credits

Screenshot paths (`assets/screenshots/01_*.png` – `06_*.png`) are pre-wired in the README and ready to be filled by capturing the running extension.

## Brand Rename: `FluxTerm` → `Flux-Term`

**What changed**: All user-facing display strings, VS Code contribution point labels, HTML webview titles, save-dialog filter labels, and notification messages were updated from `FluxTerm` to `Flux-Term`.

**Why**: Align the extension's user-visible branding with the official hyphenated product name (`Flux-Term`) consistently used in the README and marketplace `displayName`.

**Scope — updated files:**
- `package.json`: `"title": "Flux-Term: New File"`, `"displayName": "Flux-Term Editor"`
- `src/extension.ts`: activation console log, "Flux-Term Files" save-dialog filter, inline comment
- `src/extension/providers/FluxTermEditorProvider.ts`: `<title>Flux-Term Editor</title>` HTML, all `[Flux-Term EditorProvider]` log prefix strings
- `src/webview/components/block/CwdEditor.tsx`: `Flux-Term: Invalid directory` warning notification message
- `CHANGELOG.md`: header description tagline

**What did NOT change (intentionally):**
- TypeScript class/interface/variable identifiers (`FluxTermBlock`, `FluxTermService`, `FluxTermDocument`, `FluxTermCustomDocument`, `FluxTermEditorProvider`, `FluxTermDocumentSession`, `fluxTermService`, `useFluxTermDocument`) — hyphens are not valid in TypeScript identifiers.
- VS Code command contribution IDs (`fluxterm.editor`, `fluxterm.newFile`) — these are stable API surface identifiers; changing them would be a breaking change requiring all users to update keybindings/settings.
- VS Code Marketplace publisher ID (`FluxTerm`) in README badges and `package.json#publisher` — this is a live marketplace account identifier.
